LIQUID MIRROR TELESCOPES
Liquid Mirror Telescopes not only sound cool but are made using mercury which is even cooler, yet one barely knows of it. Despite one of the biggest liquid mirror telescopes being in Nainital, India the ILMT (International Liquid Mirror Telescope) with an 4 meter diameter along with a zenith base. 
Someone's idea of a telescope consists of a mirror or lens used to obtain a magnified image of celestial bodies, often passed through an eyepiece for viewing. The key component in this setup is the mirror or lens. Producing large-scale mirrors or lenses for giant telescopes is a significant challenge. Many developments have been made in optics to just allow large scale mirrors to be built. But its implementations seems hard with the price tag that's attached to huge mirrors or lenses. IN this regard using a liquid mirror telescope could solve the biggest expenditure on the mirror themselves. It should also avoid a lot of the issues that comes with creating an environment to prevent temperature changes or the force of gravity from distorting the surface. Not to mention the system of sensors and actuators that actively controls the shape of the mirror to counteract the distortions. This strategy of adaptive optics sounds scary enough that trying to avoid it as much as possible sounds good.

The liquid mirror telescopes' basic principle is that, by rotating a liquid, such as mercury or specially formulated metal alloys(Ga,etc) which would have low melting points, at high speeds, a paraboloid shape is formed. By happy coincidence, a paraboloid is exactly what is needed to focus light. Incident rays that are parallel to the axis are reflected so that they come together at one spot, the focal point of the mirror. Parallel rays arriving from other directions are not focused so perfectly. But with the addition of three or four lenses placed close to the focal point, good image quality can be obtained over an extended field of view. Most large astronomical telescopes thus employ parabolic (or nearly parabolic) primary mirrors and secondary mirrors or lenses to correct off-axis aberrations.
The idea of using a rotating liquid to focus light is not a new one. As all things physics it began with Isaac Newton figuring out this basic idea in fluid mechanics and his contributions of telescopes. Afterwards an Italian astronomer Ernesto Capocci of the Osservatorio di Capodimonte in Naples was the first to describe this possibility in print, in 1850. Another researcher Henry Skey (1836–1914), an Englishman who emigrated to New Zealand in 1860, had made an model, although there is a little documentation for it. He independently constructed a mercury telescope in the 1850s Skey presented the model at the Otago Institute in 1872 but did not specify its dimensions, though it is thought to be about 10-15 inches in diameter. His design included a plane reflector with a drive mechanism, allowing observations beyond the zenith. Which is a great idea for trying to overcome the challenges faced. But for the making of the Large Zenith Telescope (LZT) they bolded accepted this fault, as by having their research be more focused as the statistical properties of celestial bodies or distant galaxies, as such having the telescope point anywhere is the best place to look at. Robert Williams Wood (1868-1955), Professor of Experimental Physics at the Johns Hopkins University. His experiments with Liquid Mirror Telescopes are by far the most well known one. Wood used at first a 7-inch basin of mercury, and later a 20-inch one. Despite the concept seeming fruitful and him suggesting that solid mirrors could be produced by pouring a liquid resin onto the mercury surface and then aluminizing the resin after solidification. The technology of the era limited him, the main issue was a system that would allow the mercury surface to be ripple free. Imprecise speed control gave rise to fluctuations of its focal length. Because the rotation axis had to be vertical, the telescope could observe only a small area of sky directly overhead, and the rotation of the Earth resulted in constant motion of the images. Many of these have easy modern day solutions which anyone could think of.

Even after practical models being made in the 19th and 20th century. They faced numerous issues with little to no solution without other modern technologies. The models were plagued by vibrations and a small but noticeable wobbling of the mirror. What's more, imprecise speed control gave rise to fluctuations of its focal length. Because the rotation axis had to be vertical, the telescope could observe only a small area of sky directly overhead, and the rotation of the Earth resulted in constant motion of the images. Many of these have easy modern day solutions which anyone could think of.

The problem of the image drifting across the field of view as the Earth turned could be solved by replacing traditional film with a modern detector, a solid-state sensor known as a charge-coupled device (CCD). To address vibration and wobble, air bearings with precisely ground surfaces separated by a thin film of pressurized air are used. These bearings are virtually frictionless and enable smooth rotation. A synchronous motor, driven by a crystal-controlled oscillator, eliminates the speed variations that previously caused issues with older models.

ILMT: The ILMT is located at the Devasthal Observatory in India, the world's first liquid mirror telescope dedicated entirely to astronomical research. the ILMT has been providing significantly valuable contributions to various fields of astronomy, especially sky surveys and transient cosmic events.
The ILMT was primarily intended for large-scale sky surveys. It observes and catalog faint, otherwise missed astronomical objects. This includes the detection of distant galaxies, supernovae, variable stars, etc., which represent the transient cosmic events.
Survey of Variable Stars
A significant use of the ILMT is in the observation of variable stars, stars whose luminosity changes with time. Knowledge of the processes that cause such changes can be used to gain insight into stellar internal structure and stellar evolution and the behavior of different types of stars (for eg Cepheid variables, which are employed to estimate cosmic distances).
Dark Matter and Dark Energy Research
The information generated by the ILMT is as useful towards the comprehension of dark matter and dark energy as any other vast sky survey. It traces the galactic distribution, superclusters, and cosmic voids to comprehend the universe's large-scale structure in the hands of unseen forces.
Detection of Supernovae: The ILMT has played a role in the detection of supernovae, stellar bursts that emit enormous energy, therefore crucial in identifying the life span of stars, the evolution of galaxies, and the universe expansion. 
It has also contributed in detection of near-Earth objects (NEOs) such as asteroids.
ILMT is an important milestone in Indian astronomy. The Devasthal Observatory, in which ILMT is located, further enhances the capability of the country to undertake advanced astronomical research and collaborate with international scientists. The telescope provides observational capacities that have not been achievable through conventional telescopes.

LZT:
The Large Zenith Telescope (LZT), located in Canada, is one of the largest and most successful liquid mirror telescopes, along with the one most documented. It was mainly designed for large-scale sky surveys, to detect transient astronomical events, and to support research of cool stuff like gravitational wave detection, dark energy, and cosmic surveys. 
Detection of Gravitational Waves: One of the most important applications of the LZT has been in assisting (LIGO) in the detection of gravitational waves. The ability of the LZT to observe a large portion (possible cheaply due to the liquid mirror method) of the sky with high precision has contributed to understanding transient cosmic phenomena that might indicate gravitational wave sources.
Cosmic Surveys & Dark Energy Research: Cosmological Structure and Dark Energy The LZT was part of initiatives to explore large-scale structure, which could in turn be associated with dark energy. The mapping of galaxies, superclusters, and voids makes it possible to understand the universe's matter distribution and how such a distribution can be affected by dark energy.
Sky Surveys & Transient Phenomena: The wide field of view provided by the telescope allows it to monitor large areas of the sky, increasing the chances of discovering new or rare events(such as supernovae, asteroids, and variable stars). These phenomenas change rapidly or appear unexpectedly, making them hard to track.

Mapping of the Northern Sky: The LZT is designed to observe the zenith (directly overhead), making it ideal for surveying the northern hemisphere's sky.

MAKE A SIDE NOTE OR SMTH FOR WHY A PARABOLOID :
The surface of a liquid in equilibrium is a surface of constant potential energy. (Any variation of the potential along the surface would constitute a force, which would cause the liquid to flow). Normally, the potential energy of an object is just proportional to its height. So the surfaces of most liquids are flat or essentially so. But suppose that one rotates a liquid at a constant angular speed about a vertical axis. The potential energy of any tiny parcel of fluid now has two components, one that increases with height and another that decreases with distance from the rotation axis—or rather, with the square of that distance. That particular combination of dependencies makes the surface take on the shape of a paraboloid.
